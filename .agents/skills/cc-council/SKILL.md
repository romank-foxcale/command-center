name: cc-council
description: Run, approve, reject or inspect multi-model coding, testing and debug councils (Claude and GPT propose or diagnose, an anonymous judge decides, a writer implements, ./cc verify gates, Claude, GPT and Grok review security) with ./cc council, and change which provider and model each agent role uses. Use when the user wants a council to implement, test or debug something on a feature, approves or rejects a council verdict, asks about council runs, or wants a role such as judge or writer to use another model.

# CC council

First read `../_shared/cc-cli.md` and follow it.

## Commands

| Request | Command |
|---|---|
| Implement X on feature F | `./cc council run coding --feature <feature> [--repo <repo>] --task "<task>"` |
| Write tests for X on feature F | `./cc council run testing --feature <feature> [--repo <repo>] --task "<task>"` |
| Find and fix bug X on feature F | `./cc council run debug --feature <feature> [--repo <repo>] --task "<symptom>"` |
| Go ahead / approve | `./cc council approve <run-id>` |
| Use proposal B instead / change something | `./cc council approve <run-id> [--pick <label>] [--note "<instruction>"]` |
| Stop this run | `./cc council reject <run-id>` |
| What runs are there? / show run R | `./cc council status [<run-id>]` |
| Are my subscriptions logged in? | `./cc doctor` |

## Rules

- The feature worktree must exist (`cc-worktree`) and be clean; the council refuses uncommitted changes. A plan work package makes the best task: pass it with `--task-file`.
- Write the task as an outcome with constraints and acceptance, not as a design: the proposers design.
- For a debug council, describe the symptom exactly (input, expected, actual, platform, error text), never a suspected cause. The runner first runs verify and gives its output to the investigators; after approval the writer must produce a reproduction test that fails, and only then the fix. Stage `failed` with "does not reproduce the bug" means the chosen diagnosis was wrong; "fixes failed: question the design" means three fixes failed and the design needs a conversation, not a fourth attempt.
- A run stops after the verdict. Show the user the verdict and the hidden proposal authors, and wait for an explicit decision; never approve on the user's behalf.
- Runs take minutes. Run them in the background when the tool allows it and report the final stage line and the artifacts folder. The user must never have to ask for progress: right after starting or approving a run in the background, run `./cc watch <run-id>` as a streaming watcher (the Monitor tool where available) and relay each event to the user as it arrives, in one short line: steps, handoffs between agents (`⇄`), what agents say (`💬`), stalls (`⚠`, an agent silent for 3 minutes), errors and the end (`■`). Say a stall plainly ("the GPT proposer has been silent 4 minutes, last reading X") and keep waiting; it is a warning, not a failure. Re-arm the watcher if it expires before the end event. `./cc watch` without an id follows the newest unfinished run. `state.json` in the run folder holds the plan, the current step and each call's start and finish time.
- Councils verify with `--quality`. A `done` summary that ends in `WARNING: mutation gate missing` means the tests were not checked against injected bugs; repeat that warning to the user. "tests pass but miss injected bugs" means the mutation gate failed.
- Final stages: `done` (verify passed; the user reviews `changes.diff` and commits), `verify-failed` (report the log; for testing it means suspected bugs), `blocked-security` (report `security.md` and, when a reviewer's high finding blocked it, that `review-<role>.md` and the review authors the run printed), `rejected`, `failed`. Never commit, push or fix things after the run on your own.

## Roles and models

Roles are `catalog/agents/<role>.json`: `provider` (`claude`, `codex` or `cursor`), `model`, `access` (`read-only` or `write-worktree`), `skills`. Councils are `catalog/councils/<name>.json` and name the roles for `proposers`, `judge`, `writer` and `security` (a list of reviewers; with several, the judge summarizes them), plus `approval` and `maxRetries`.

- Change a role with `./cc council set-role <role> [--provider claude|codex|cursor] [--model <model>]`, and a council with `./cc council set <council> [--approval on|off] [--max-retries N]`; both validate and refuse an invalid change. Never edit the JSON by hand. List models with `./cc council models` (Codex: `codex debug models`; Cursor: `cursor-agent models`); Claude accepts aliases such as `opus` and `sonnet` or full model ids.
- Settings (roles and models, councils) can also be changed with the `cc-settings` skill in chat or `./cc settings` in a terminal.
- "How is it going?": run `./cc council status <run>` and summarize it: the progress bar, the current step, which agents are done or still working, the timers, and what each working agent did last (its log lines). Without a run id, `./cc council status` lists all runs with their progress.
- Proposers, judge and security must stay `read-only`; only the writer is `write-worktree`. Cursor roles can only be `read-only`: Cursor's write limits are not enforced by the CC. Validation enforces both.
- After updating `cursor-agent`, prove its read-only confinement still holds with `python3 scripts/council/providers.py probe cursor <model>` (it must print `no writes`).
- A council needs at least two proposers. Using the same provider for every proposer defeats the point; warn the user if they ask for it.
