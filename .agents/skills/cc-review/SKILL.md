name: cc-review
description: Review a pull request of a catalog repo (or a feature's diff) against a fixed bar - report only [BREAK] (it breaks the build, tests or runtime), [SCOPE] (it contradicts or misses the stated scope and acceptance criteria from the PR or its Trello card) and [KNOWLEDGE] (it contradicts a note in the CC's docs), each with evidence, and give a CLEAN verdict with what was checked when nothing clears the bar. Use when the user asks to review a PR or a feature, or picks "Review it" in cc-prs.

# CC review

First read `../_shared/cc-cli.md` and follow it.

A review answers one question: **should this merge as it is?** Zero findings is a normal, valid result. Never search for something to say: an invented finding costs the user more than a missed nit.

## 1. Gather

1. `./cc prs show <repo> <number> --diff`: description, files, diff and the Trello cards linked from the PR.
2. For each linked card: `./cc trello show --card <url>` (description and checklists). If Trello is not connected, say so and continue with the PR alone.
3. Read the code around every changed hunk in the repo's base clone (`./cc repo list` names the repos; `../repos/<id>`), not the diff alone.
4. Build: when the repo has gates (status `adapted` or `verified` in `./cc repo list`), run `./cc prs checkout <repo> <number>`, then `./cc feature pr-<repo>-<number> verify` in the background, following it with `./cc watch`. A gate the PR makes fail is a `[BREAK]` whose scenario is the failing gate and its error. If the failure is in code the PR does not touch, confirm with `./cc verify <repo>` on the main branch; failing there too, it is pre-existing and not a finding. Without gates, write "Build: not run (no Nix gates for <repo>)" and judge breaks from the code. Afterwards offer `./cc worktree remove pr-<repo>-<number>`.
5. Knowledge: open `docs/index.md` and only the notes about this repo, the touched area or the technologies used: decisions, rules, hacks, debt and `docs/projects/`. Ignore `superseded` notes.

## 2. Search, then filter

Search hard for each tag; then keep only what passes its bar.

| Tag | Search for | Bar to report it |
|---|---|---|
| `[BREAK]` | Compile and type errors, broken imports, a removed or renamed symbol still used (grep the repo), changed API, schema or message contracts with their consumers (including other catalog repos), migrations, config and env keys, dependency changes, deleted or disabled tests, new code paths that throw or return wrong results on ordinary input | A concrete scenario: this input or step → this failure. If the failure is only reachable through a condition the code already rules out, drop it |
| `[SCOPE]` | Each acceptance criterion and scope statement in the PR or its cards; changes unrelated to the stated purpose | The exact criterion it misses or contradicts, quoted with its source. Unrelated changes count only when substantial (another feature, module or behaviour), not a drive-by rename |
| `[KNOWLEDGE]` | Conflicts with a decision, rule, hack's removal condition or recorded constraint | The note's path and the sentence it contradicts |

Before keeping a finding, try to refute it: read callers, tests, validation and config that might already handle it. If the refutation holds, drop the finding. If it stays plausible but cannot be settled from the code, keep it with `(unconfirmed: <how to confirm>)`, for example the gate to run.

Never report: style, naming, formatting, comments, "consider", "might be cleaner", refactors, micro-performance, missing tests for code that works, or problems that existed before this PR and that it does not make worse. These are not findings. List up to 3 as `[NIT]` only when the user asks for nits.

## 3. Report

```
<repo> #<number> · <title>
Verdict: CLEAN | <n> finding(s)

[BREAK] path:line · what breaks. Scenario: <input/step> → <failure>. Fix: <one line>.
[SCOPE] path:line · misses "<criterion>" (<PR | card url>). Fix: <one line>.
[KNOWLEDGE] path:line · contradicts <note path>: "<sentence>". Fix: <one line>.

Checked
- Build: <gate run and result | not run: <why>>
- Scope (<source>): ✓ <criterion> · ✗ <criterion> · ? <criterion that cannot be judged from the code>
- Knowledge: <notes read>
```

- Order findings by tag (BREAK, SCOPE, KNOWLEDGE), then by impact.
- Always print the Checked block, for CLEAN too: it is what makes a clean verdict trustworthy. With no acceptance criteria anywhere, say "no acceptance criteria stated; checked against the PR title and description".
- The review stays in the chat. Posting it to GitHub or Trello, approving or requesting changes are outward-facing: only when the user asks, after showing the exact text and getting a yes.
